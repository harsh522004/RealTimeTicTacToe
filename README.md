## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture with the following main components:

- **Flutter App**: The client-side application developed using Flutter.
- **Node.js Server**: The server-side application handling socket connections and game logic.
- **Riverpod**: State management solution used in the Flutter app.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Flutter SDK: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Node.js and npm: [Node.js Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Running the App

1. **Start the Node.js server**:
